# crypto-price-predictor

Creating a cryptocurrency price predictor is a complex task that involves machine learning and financial analysis. In this example, I'll provide a simplified Python script that uses historical price data to make predictions using a basic linear regression model. Please note that this is a basic example for educational purposes, and real-world cryptocurrency price prediction is far more complex and requires more advanced models and data.
